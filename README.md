A game (PvP or solo) to practice for tests (PSAT/SAT/ACT, more later). Can play as guest, can chat. Create or join a game, rating will change based on rank compared to those with similar ratings.

Based off of Art of Problem Solving's For the Win (FTW), specifically the old version that used Adobe Flash.
